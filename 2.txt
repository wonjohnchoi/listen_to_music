Dmitri Shostakovich Symphony No 5 in D minor, Op. 47 IV.Allegro non troppo
Quote: "Good to listen to when you want feel very energetic" - Sung ChangHun

Tempo is very fast. Beats in this song are pointy and generally high.
As the result, initially, you feel energetic. But after times goes,
tempo and beats both go up and gets pointier. At some point, you feel a sense of emergency
and scared. Then comes a period of calmness and slience.
